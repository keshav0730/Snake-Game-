# Snake-Game-using-Python

In this program I have build a classic Snake Game using Turtle Graphics which we use to play in old mobiles. Over here Object Oriented Programming is being used to develop this game 
It contains 5 files and they are
1. **main.py**
   This files contains all the code that has to be executed to make game successfull
2. **food.py**
   This files contains a program that generates food for snake randomly
3. **scoreboard.py**
   This files keeps the track of the score
4. **snakebody.py**
   This files makes the body of the snake and increases when food is eaten by snake
5. **design.py**
   This is just a design template files which makes boundaries on game
